PAES-SOFTWARE-SHAPEDETECTION
Introduction

The PAES-SOFTWARE-SHAPEDETECTION module is a part of the Patient Assistance and Entertainment System (PAES). This module uses OpenCV to detect and classify shapes in an image. It supports detecting lines, triangles, rectangles, squares, pentagons, and circles.
Features

    Shape Detection: Detects and classifies various geometric shapes in an image.
    Edge Detection: Uses the Canny edge detection algorithm.
    Contour Analysis: Analyzes contours to classify shapes based on the number of vertices and circularity.

Technologies Used

    C++
    OpenCV for image processing and shape detection.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

    C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
    OpenCV library

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/PAES-SOFTWARE-SHAPEDETECTION.git
cd PAES-SOFTWARE-SHAPEDETECTION

Install OpenCV:

    Follow the OpenCV installation guide for your platform.

Compile the code:

sh

    g++ -o shape_detection shape_detection.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`

Usage Instructions
Running the Shape Detection Program

    Place the image you want to process in the same directory as the executable and name it image.png or adjust the code to use a different image name.
    Run the program:

    sh

    ./shape_detection

Example Output

The program will print the detected shape to the console. For example:

mathematica

Detected Shape: Circle
